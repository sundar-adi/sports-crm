# HPTX Frontend

## Prerequisites

You will need Node to work with this repo. Instructions for installing Node can be found on the Node.js website at https://nodejs.org/en/download/.

Additionally, please use Yarn instead of NPM for managing packages and running scripts. You can install Yarn through the [Homebrew package manager](https://brew.sh/). This will also install Node.js if it is not already installed.

```
brew install yarn
```

## Installing

Once you download the repo, you will need to install all neccesary dependencies.

```
yarn install
```

Next, run the app in development mode.

```
yarn start
```

Now, your vue components will reload while working in django views.



## Build for production

```
$ yarn build
```
